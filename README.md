OpenRV
======

OpenRemoteViewer (OpenRV) implements the VNC/RFB protocol to connect to a VNC server.
The library (libopenrv) provides a pure C interface (the library itself is internally
implemented in C++ but does not expose a C++ interface).
Supported platforms are currently mobile platforms (Android, iOS) and Desktop systems (Linux, Mac
OSX, Windows).
